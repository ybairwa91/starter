Environment Variables:
1.Environment variables are dynamic values that can affect how a program behaves.
2.They are set outside the application and can be accessed within the code.

process.env:
In Node.js, process.env is an object that contains all environment variables.
You can access environment variables using the dot notation (e.g., process.env.VARIABLE_NAME).

NODE_ENV:
NODE_ENV is a common environment variable used in web development.
It typically indicates the environment in which your application is running (e.g., development, production, testing).

Common values for NODE_ENV:
development: Used during local development.
production: Used in a live production environment.

//see middlewares execute evrytime btw a request-response cycle until and unless u specified a path,so if u specify a path it will only
//execute when u hit that request and same happening here as well.
//routers middleware 


// app.use() is a method that adds middleware functions to the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
// Middleware functions can process requests, modify the request or response objects, or perform other tasks.
// parameter of app.use()
// first parameter
// '/api/v1/tours':
// This is the path or route where the middleware will be applied.
// When a client sends an HTTP request to this path (e.g., GET /api/v1/tours), the middleware will be executed.
// tourRouter:
// tourRouter is likely an instance of an Express router.
// Routers allow you to define routes and their associated handlers separately from the main application.
// It contains route definitions related to tours (e.g., GET /, POST /, GET /:id, etc.).
// What It Does:
// When a client sends a request to the path /api/v1/tours, the tourRouter middleware will handle it.
// Depending on the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE), the corresponding route handler from tourRouter will be executed.
//  // tourRoutes.js
// const express = require('express');
// const tourController = require('../controllers/tourController');

// const router = express.Router();

// // Define route for getting all tours
// router.route('/').get(tourController.getAllTours);

// module.exports = router;
